# Project 3: Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## Overview
This project focuses on building a model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using natural language processing techniques.

## Objective
Develop a model that achieves an F1 score of at least 0.85 in classifying movie reviews.

## Approach 
- Data Preprocessing: Loaded IMDB dataset, cleaned text, handled class imbalance.
- Exploratory Analysis: Analyzed review lengths, word frequencies.
- Model Training: Trained Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting. Used F1 score for evaluation.
- Evaluation: Achieved F1 > 0.85, met target threshold.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Gradient Boosting

## Conclusion
The sentiment analysis model effectively classified movie reviews as positive or negative, achieving an F1 score above the target threshold of 0.85. This demonstrates its applicability for sentiment analysis tasks, providing a reliable tool for understanding customer feedback and opinions.

The model could be integrated into movie platforms to provide real-time sentiment analysis of user reviews, aiding content recommendation algorithms. Expanding the model to analyze sentiments in other media like books or music could broaden its use. Aspect-based sentiment analysis could also be implemented to understand specific elements (like plot, acting) that drive positive or negative feedback.
