# data-science-portfolio
Hi, I'm Esdros Yohannes, a data science enthusiast with a passion for solving real-world problems. I've finished learning data science and I'm working on building a strong portfolio to land a job in the field.

I'm excited to showcase my projects, which include: Gold Recovery Prediction: A project focused on predicting gold recovery rates using machine learning models, with a focus on data preprocessing, feature analysis, and model evaluation. Customer Segmentation for Insurance: A project aimed at identifying similar customers for targeted marketing, predicting insurance benefits, and protecting client data through data masking techniques.

Used Car Price Prediction: A project that leverages machine learning to predict used car prices based on technical specifications and other factors, with a focus on model performance and speed. Movie Review Sentiment Analysis: A project that uses natural language processing to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, with a goal of achieving an F1 score of at least 0.85. Through these projects, I'm developing skills in data preprocessing, machine learning, and data visualization, and I'm excited to apply these skills to real-world problems in the data science field.
