3. [Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews](#sentiment-analysis-of-movie-reviews)
4. [Used Car Price Prediction](#used-car-price-prediction)

I'm excited to showcase my projects, which include: Gold Recovery Prediction: A project focused on predicting gold recovery rates using machine learning models, with a focus on data preprocessing, feature analysis, and model evaluation. Age Verification for Alcohol Sales: A project to build and evaluate a model for verifying people's age from photos to help supermarkets adhere to alcohol laws.

Used Car Price Prediction: A project that leverages machine learning to predict used car prices based on technical specifications and other factors, with a focus on model performance and speed. Movie Review Sentiment Analysis: A project that uses natural language processing to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, with a goal of achieving an F1 score of at least 0.85. Through these projects, I'm developing skills in data preprocessing, machine learning, and data visualization, and I'm excited to apply these skills to real-world problems in the data science field.
