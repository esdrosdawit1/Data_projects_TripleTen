# Project 2: Gold Recovery Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict gold recovery from gold ore using machine learning models.

## Objective
Develop a model to predict gold recovery and evaluate its performance.

## Approach 
- Data Preparation: Cleaned and analyzed industrial process data, handled missing values.
- Feature Engineering: Selected relevant features impacting gold recovery (correlation analysis).
- Model Training: Trained Random Forest, Linear Regression, Decision Tree using cross-validation.
- Model Optimization: Tuned hyperparameters for Random Forest (best performer).

## Models Used
- Random Forest
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree

## Findings
- Random Forest performed best: sMAPE 8.58 (validation), 12.10 (test).
- Linear Regression: sMAPE 13.18. Decision Tree: sMAPE 12.86.
